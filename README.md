Worked on the single site sequential processing script again, with a better understanding of the goal.

I had an initial idea, but was given a sugestion of a different way to implement it. I ended up implementing both, and running numerous tests to see which one was better.

I did quite a bit of work without a clear understanding of my goals all while motivated by bordom due to insomnia leading to messy and near useless code.
